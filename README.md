# AI Humanizer Clipboard

A Raycast extension that helps make AI-generated text appear more natural by removing common machine-generated markers.

## What it Does

Text generated by tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini often contains subtle indicators that reveal its machine origin:
- Hidden Characters: Zero-width spaces (U+200B) and similar invisible elements
- Unusual Typography: Em dashes, smart quotes, and other non-standard punctuation
- Irregular Spacing: Non-breaking spaces and inconsistent whitespace

This extension scans for these markers and strips them out, helping the text appear more natural and reducing the chances of detection.

## Installation

1. Install [Raycast](https://raycast.com/)
2. Open Raycast and go to Extensions
3. Search for "AI Humanizer Clipboard"
4. Click Install

## Usage

1. Copy the text from your AI assistant
2. Open Raycast (âŒ˜ + Space)
3. Type "Humanize AI" or use the keyboard shortcut
4. The cleaned text will be automatically pasted to your clipboard
